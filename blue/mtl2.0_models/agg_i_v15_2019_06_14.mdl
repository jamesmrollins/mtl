	~	When the team uses overtime, one of the long-term costs is burnout. \
		Persistently working long workweeks relative to normal eventually \
		increases provider quit rate, and thus reduces actual team hours \
		available. The more persistent overtime a team works, the greater this \
		effect, and the more the quit rate will increase, compared to the norm.  \
		This effect only applies to overtime: persistently working lower than the \
		official work hours does not create new staff hours or attract other staff \
		to work on this team. (pct)

		(e.g., appointment prep, charting, follow-up, reminder calls).  The more \
		overtime a team works, the greater this effect, and the more the missed \

Sensitivity of Overtime to Work Pressure= GAME (

	~	Dmnl [0,2,0.1]
	~	This controls the magnitude of the effect work pressure has on overtime, \
		where an increase in appointment backlog causes the team to work more \
		"unofficial" hours to increase the completion rate to mitigate that \
		increase. A value of "zero" implies that the team will not use overtime or \
		overbook appointments for any amount of work pressure. A value of "1" \
		implies that there is a direct relationship between work pressure and the \
		amount of overtime used (e.g., doubling the work pressure will also double \
		the hours worked per week). For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would \
		only increase the hours worked to 41% over the original value, and a value \
		of 1.5 would increase the hours worked to 182% over the original value.

Sensitivity of Scheduled Return Visit Interval to Work Pressure= GAME (

	~	Dmnl [0,2,0.1]
	~	This controls the magnitude of the effect of work pressure has on the \
		return to clinic interval (RVI), where an increase in appointment backlog \
		causes the team to extend the scheduled RVI for current patients. A value \
		of "zero" implies that the team will not delay existing patients' care \
		(i.e., extend patients' RVI) for any amount of work pressure. A value of \
		"1" implies that there is a direct relationship between work pressure and \
		RVI (e.g., doubling the work pressure will also double the RVI). For the \
		same situation, a value of "0.5" would only increase the RVI by 41% over \
		its original value, and a value of 1.5 would increase the RVI by 182% over \
		the original value.

"Sensitivity of Staff Burnout Due to Long-Term Overtime"= GAME (
	1)
	~	Dmnl [0,2,0.1]
	~	This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in overtime has on team \
		burnout and quits. A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship \
		between overtime and burnout and quits. A value of "1" implies the \
		assumption that doubling the hours worked over the official hours will \
		eventually cause enough quits to cut the official hours offered in half. \
		For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would eventually reduce the \
		official team hours to 71% of its original value, and a value of 1.5 would \
		reduce the official hours to 35% of the original.
	|

"Sensitivity of Staff Missed Appointments Due to Short-Term Overtime"= GAME (
	1)
	~	Dmnl [0,2,0.1]
	~	This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in overtime have on time \
		for non-patient-facing care tasks and missed appointments. A value of \
		"zero" implies that there is no relationship between overtime and missed \
		appointments. A value below 1 indicates that providers are not sensitive \
		to small changes in overtime and non-patient-facing task time; a value \
		greater than 1 indicates that providers are very sensitive to small \
		changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week than \
		their official supply, then an value of "1" would indicate that the ratio \
		of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% higher than \
		before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20% increase in hours \
		worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5% increase in the \
		missed appointment percentage). A value of "2" would cause that same 20% \
		increase to have a greater effect ( raising the missed appointment \
		percentage by 44%).

"Short-Term Overtime"=

	~	Dmnl
	~	The ratio of the team's total excess hours worked to their total official \
		hours, averaged over the past 3 weeks.  When the team is working zero \
		overtime, this ratio will be zero.  If the team is working as much \
		overtime as they have official time, then this ratio will be 100%.  (pct)
