Acceptable Delay to Starting Service	The team's goal to start patients in any service within one week of their intake appointment.
Adjuctive % w PTSD	The fraction of patients who have PTSD as a primary diagnosis in each service. These fractions are likely to sum to >100%, as they are not mutually exclusive (i.e., a patient can have a primary diagnosis of OUD in one visit, and then DEP in a subsequent visit, which would count them in both cohorts).

Adjunctive Actual Return Visit Interval	The actual average return-to-clinic visit interval that patients experience. This is either the same as the RVI used when appointments are scheduled, or potentially longer, if the team reacts to work pressure by extending existing patients' RVI. Longer than desired RVIs do not cause patients or providers to cancel appointments. In theory, the actual RVI could be pushed to more than one year, but we've capped it at 52 weeks. (wks)
Adjunctive Actual Service Capacity	The effective total hours of clinical time available, based on the percentage of the total team hours allocated to each service, and the missed appointment percentage for each service. This assumes that all missed appointments are eventually rescheduled.

It is constrained from going below zero. The baseline rate can be replaced by a user-generated value between zero and 100%.
Adjunctive Appointment Rate for Service Capacity	The appointment completion rate is the rate at which appointments would be completed in each service by the current team at the standard allocation of hours and hours lost to appointment re-scheduling for each service. Used to initialize the model, so the referral, start, and end rates for patients in each service is in equilibrium.
Adjunctive Appointment Supply	The number of official appointments offered each week. This value replaces the default value estimated from the team's data, with the assumption that any increase in supply comes from reducing appointments offered in other services. (appt/wk)

If there is more demand than supply, then not all scheduled appointments will be seen in a timely manner, and Actual RVI will increase. This is different from a completed visit, as the appointment is still complete even if the patient no-shows.  (appt/wk)
Adjunctive Current Pt Appts / week	The total number of existing patient appointments per week, determined by the total number of patients in each service, the number of patients per appointent, and that service's return visit interval.

Adjunctive Effect of RVI Delays on Treatment Decisions	When care delays increase (as measured by the return to clinic visit intervals (RVI) for a service increasing above the scheduled RVI), the team will be less likely to decide that patient should start that service. This effect only applies to actual RVIs rising above scheduled RVIs: lower than scheduled RVIs do not increase provider decisions to start patients. (pct)
Adjunctive Effect of Start Delays on Treatment Decisions	When the wait time to start a service increases above the target wait time, the team will be less likely to decide that patient should start that service.

Adjunctive Effect of Work Pressure on Overtime	When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure." One response to increasing work pressure is for the team to work overtime. The more work pressure a team experiences for a specific service, the greater this effect, and the more the overtime the team will work in that specific service. This effect only applies to increasing work pressure: having fewer appointments on the calendar that the team can see in a timely way does not influence providers to work fewer hours. (pct)
Adjunctive Effect of Work Pressure on Scheduled Return Visit Interval	When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure." One response to increasing work pressure is for the team to see their patients less often. The more work pressure a team experiences for a specific service, the greater this effect, and the longer the scheduled return to clinic interval (RVI) for that specific service. This effect only applies to increasing work pressure: having fewer appointments on the calendar that the team can see in a timely way does not influence providers to see patients more often. (pct)

Adjunctive Return Visit Interval (RVI)	The scheduled average return to clinic visit interval for each service, regardless of whether or not the team has enough supply for the patient demand or the effect on new patient starts. This value replaces the base case value, which is estimated from the team's data. (wks)
Adjunctive RVI	The team's goal to see each patient in each service once in every x week (default RVIs are based on the team's data). The default RVI can be replaced by a user-generated value between 1 and 16 weeks. The "RVI" for Intake is always 1 week, which ensures that patients only have one intake appointment before completing Intake.

Adjunctive Scheduled Return Visit Interval	The return-to-clinic visit interval (RVI) used when scheduling appointmnents for existing patients in each service. It is either the same as the RVI from the team's data, or longer, depending on how the team chooses to react to increasing work pressure. (wks)

These replace the base case values, which are estimated directly from team data on new service start rates for each service in the team (i.e., haven't had this service in the team in the last six months). These percentages can sum to >1, as providers can decided to start a patient in multiple services. (pct)
Adjunctive User-defined True Missed Appointment %	The percent of appointments that must be re-scheduled, as either the clinician or the patient missed the appointment. This replaces the base case value, which is estimated from team data. (appts/wk)
Adjunctive Work Pressure	When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure." It is measured by the ratio of the hours needed for each service (based on the appointments on the calendar and the return to clinic interval) against the actual hours available for each service. When the team works the same hours as their patients need (so each patient can be seen at the appropriate return to clinic interval), then the ratio is 1.

These fractions are likely to sum to >100%, as they are not mutually exclusive (i.e., a patient can have a primary diagnosis of OUD in one visit, and then DEP in a subsequent visit, which would count them in both cohorts). Also, some patients engage in multiple services simultaneously, and thus count in multiple service cohorts.
EBPsych Actual Engagement Time	The actual time patients spend in a service depends on both the median time estimated from the team's visit data and the effect of provider fatigue on patient engagement.

EBPsych Actual Return Visit Interval	The actual average return-to-clinic visit interval that patients experience. This is either the same as the RVI used when appointments are scheduled, or potentially longer, if the team reacts to work pressure by extending existing patients' RVI. Longer than desired RVIs do not cause patients or providers to cancel appointments. In theory, the actual RVI could be pushed to more than one year, but we've capped it at 52 weeks. (wks)
EBPsych Actual Service Capacity	The effective total hours of clinical time available, based on the percentage of the total team hours allocated to each service, and the missed appointment percentage for each service. This assumes that all missed appointments are eventually rescheduled.
EBPsych Actual True Missed Appointment %	The percent of appointments missed and rescheduled is affected by both the baseline rate and the effect of fatigue due to accumulated long hours. It is constrained from going below zero. The baseline rate can be replaced by a user-generated value between zero and 100%.
EBPsych Appointment Rate for Service Capacity	The appointment completion rate is the rate at which appointments would be completed in each service by the current team at the standard allocation of hours and hours lost to appointment re-scheduling for each service. Used to initialize the model, so the referral, start, and end rates for patients in each service is in equilibrium.
EBPsych Appointment Supply	The number of official appointments offered each week. This value replaces the default value estimated from the team's data, with the assumption that any increase in supply comes from reducing appointments offered in other services. (appt/wk)
EBPsych Appointment Supply (median)	The number of appointments available with this team for each service each week. The estimate is calculated using the volume of visits completed each week with the team in each service over one year. (appt/wk)
EBPsych Appointments	The total number of appontments for each service on the calendar. (appts)
EBPsych Appointments to Reschedule	The number of appointments to be rescheduled for each service. This assumes that all missed appointments are eventually rescheduled. (appts)
EBPsych Booking Rate	The booking rate combines demand from both existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) and new patients' first appointments. (appt/wk)
EBPsych Completing Rate	Appointment completions in each service are based on the team either satisfing all the demand from existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) or using all the supply allocated to that service (based on the Appointment Supply). If there is more demand than supply, then not all scheduled appointments will be seen in a timely manner, and Actual RVI will increase. This is different from a completed visit, as the appointment is still complete even if the patient no-shows.  (appt/wk)
EBPsych Current Pt Appts / week	The total number of existing patient appointments per week, determined by the total number of patients in each service, the number of patients per appointent, and that service's return visit interval.
EBPsych Delay to Starting Service	The average delay time for the team's patients to start in a service after either an intake appointment or review. It is calculated from the number of patients delayed and the rate at which they start each service.  Delay time is capped at 52 weeks (wks)

EBPsych Difference between Actual and Standard RVI	Ratio of services' acutal RVI to the team's desired RVI.
EBPsych Effect of Care Delays on Treatment Decisions	
EBPsych Effect of RVI Delays on Treatment Decisions	When care delays increase (as measured by the return to clinic visit intervals (RVI) for a service increasing above the scheduled RVI), the team will be less likely to decide that patient should start that service. This effect only applies to actual RVIs rising above scheduled RVIs: lower than scheduled RVIs do not increase provider decisions to start patients. (pct)
EBPsych Effect of Start Delays on Treatment Decisions	When the wait time to start a service increases above the target wait time, the team will be less likely to decide that patient should start that service. This effect only applies to above-target wait times: lower than expected wait times do not increase provider decisions to start patients. (pct)
EBPsych Effect of Work Pressure on Overtime	When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure." One response to increasing work pressure is for the team to work overtime. The more work pressure a team experiences for a specific service, the greater this effect, and the more the overtime the team will work in that specific service. This effect only applies to increasing work pressure: having fewer appointments on the calendar that the team can see in a timely way does not influence providers to work fewer hours. (pct)
EBPsych Effect of Work Pressure on Scheduled Return Visit Interval	When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure." One response to increasing work pressure is for the team to see their patients less often. The more work pressure a team experiences for a specific service, the greater this effect, and the longer the scheduled return to clinic interval (RVI) for that specific service. This effect only applies to increasing work pressure: having fewer appointments on the calendar that the team can see in a timely way does not influence providers to see patients more often. (pct)
EBPsych Ending Service Rate	The number of patients finishing a service is a function the number of patients in treatment and their median time engaged in treatment. (pts/wk)
EBPsych Engagement Duration	
EBPsych Engagement Duration (median)	These estimated service durations do not include patients who only come for one visit ("one-n-dones" are a significant portion of all patient visits).
EBPsych Hours for Calculating Total Official Team Hours	Use the Baseline hours available for appointments for calculating the Total Official Team Clinical Hours, unless the users has set a new value for a service.
EBPsych Initial Patients	The initial number of patients seen by the team is determined by the initial appointment completion rate and the demand per patient. Note that the equation type is INITIAL, which ensures that the initial patient load remains constant even if the appointment completion rate varies. By setting this initial patient load, we ensure that appointments are booked at exactly the rate the team can handle, given the team size and standard values for time per appoitment, return visit interval, missed opportunities, and % team time allocated to each service.
EBPsych Maximum Completion Rate	The maximum completion rate is determined by the appointment backlog and minimum time between patient appointments.
EBPsych Maximum Start Rate Service	The maximum new patient start rate is determined by the new patient waiting list and minimum time to schedule patient appointments.

This value replaces the base case value, which is estimated from the team's data. (wks)
EBPsych RVI	The team's goal to see each patient in each service once in every x week (default RVIs are based on the team's data). The default RVI can be replaced by a user-generated value between 1 and 16 weeks. The "RVI" for Intake is always 1 week, which ensures that patients only have one intake appointment before completing Intake.
EBPsych RVI used when Completing	Appointments are completed based on the RVI in use at the time they were booked. Any change in the RVI does not affect appointments already booked, only appointments being booked (i.e., appointments are not cancelled and rescheduled when RVI changes).
EBPsych Scheduled Return Visit Interval	The return-to-clinic visit interval (RVI) used when scheduling appointmnents for existing patients in each service. It is either the same as the RVI from the team's data, or longer, depending on how the team chooses to react to increasing work pressure. (wks)
EBPsych Service Proportions	The service percentage used by the team.
EBPsych Service Proportions Balanced Across Team Variables	The percentage of patients who complete an intake who start another service, determined by the available capacity to treat those patients. If any of these percentages is >1, then there is enough supply for patients to enroll in a service multiple times simultaneously.
EBPsych Service Proportions from Team Data	The proportion of patients who start in each service with this team. The percentages sum to more than one, because patients may engage in multiple services concurrently. (pct)
EBPsych Starting a Service Rate	The number of patients who start each service each week. It is based on the number of appointments remaining each week, after all exisiting patients are seen in a timely manner. The team either satisfies all the demand from existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) or uses all the supply (based on the Appointment Supply), leaving no appointments available for new patients. (pts/wk)

EBPsych True Missed Appointment Rate	The number of appointments that must be re-scheduled, as either the clinician or the patient missed the appointment, calculated from the team's data. (appts/wk)
EBPsych User-defined Engagement Duration	The percentage of patients who are recommended to start each service after completing either an intake evaluation or review. These replace the base case values, which are estimated from team data on the appointment supply, Return-to-clinic Visit Interval (RVI), missed appointment percentage, and median engagement (i.e., the available capacity to treat patients in a timely manner) in each service. These percentages can sum to >1, as providers can decide to start a patient in multiple services. (pct)
EBPsych User-defined Service Proportions from Team Data	The percentage of patients who are recommended to start each service after completing either an intake evaluation or review. These replace the base case values, which are estimated directly from team data on new service start rates for each service in the team (i.e., haven't had this service in the team in the last six months). These percentages can sum to >1, as providers can decided to start a patient in multiple services. (pct)
EBPsych User-defined True Missed Appointment %	The percent of appointments that must be re-scheduled, as either the clinician or the patient missed the appointment. This replaces the base case value, which is estimated from team data. (appts/wk)
EBPsych Work Pressure	When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure." It is measured by the ratio of the hours needed for each service (based on the appointments on the calendar and the return to clinic interval) against the actual hours available for each service. When the team works the same hours as their patients need (so each patient can be seen at the appropriate return to clinic interval), then the ratio is 1. If a team has more appointments than they can see given the RVI, then work pressure will rise above 1. (pct)
Effect of Long-Term Overtime on Burnout	When the team uses overtime, one of the long-term costs is burnout. Persistently working long workweeks relative to normal eventually increases provider quit rate, and thus reduces actual team hours available. The more persistent overtime a team works, the greater this effect, and the more the quit rate will increase, compared to the norm. This effect only applies to overtime: persistently working lower than the official work hours does not create new staff hours or attract other staff to work on this team. (pct)
Effect of Provider Fatigue on Patient's Engagement Time	When the team uses overtime, one of the long-term costs is fatigue and lower patient satisfaction. Persistently working long workweeks relative to normal eventually reduces patients' satisfaction and thus reduces the average time patients are engaged in care. The more persistent overtime a team works, the greater this effect, and the more the engagement time will decrease, compared to the norm. This effect only applies to overtime: persistently working lower than the official work hours does not increase patient satisfaction and engagement time. (pct)
Effect of Short-Term Overtime on Missed Appointments	When the team uses overtime, one of the short-term costs is that they have less time available for important, but non-patient-facing care tasks (e.g., appointment prep, charting, follow-up, reminder calls). The more overtime a team works, the greater this effect, and the more the missed appointment rate will increase, compared to the norm. This effect only applies to overtime: working lower than the official work hours does not influence providers or patients to come more regularly to their appointments. (pct)
Fatigue Onset Time	Time for the extended workweeks to have an impact on employee fatigue and capability to keep appointments (from Oliva).
FINAL TIME	The final time for the simulation.
Group % of Hours per Service	The ratio of hours used for any one service compared to the total team hours.

Also, some patients engage in multiple services simultaneously, and thus count in multiple service cohorts.
Group % w DEP	The fraction of patients who have Depression as a primary diagnosis in each service. These fractions are likely to sum to >100%, as they are not mutually exclusive (i.e., a patient can have a primary diagnosis of OUD in one visit, and then DEP in a subsequent visit, which would count them in both cohorts).

Intake Appointments to Reschedule	The number of appointments to be rescheduled for each service. This assumes that all missed appointments are eventually rescheduled. (appts)
Intake Appropriate Intake Evaluations for Supply	
Intake Booking Rate	The booking rate combines demand from both existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) and new patients' first appointments. (appt/wk)
Intake Completing Rate	Appointment completions in each service are based on the team either satisfing all the demand from existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) or using all the supply allocated to that service (based on the Appointment Supply). If there is more demand than supply, then not all scheduled appointments will be seen in a timely manner, and Actual RVI will increase. This is different from a completed visit, as the appointment is still complete even if the patient no-shows.  (appt/wk)
Intake Completion Rate	The number of patients who complete an intake evaluation with the team per week, based on the supply allocated to conducting intake evaluations. (pts/wk)
Intake Demand per Patient per Week	Baseline number of appointments generated per patient per week for a service.
Intake Desired Clinical Hours	This is the desired service capacity based on the desired appoinutment completion rate and the standard time per appointment.
Intake Desired Completion Rate	To complete recurring appointments in the target return interval, the completion rate must be equal to the appointment backlog divided by the target return time interval.
Intake Difference between Intake Eval Wait Times	Ratio of team's acutal new patient start delay to the team's standard for acceptable start delay.
Intake Effect of Wait Times on Intake Evaluation Rate	When the wait time to start a service increases above the target wait time, referring providers will be less likely to refer a new patient to that service. This effect only applies to above-target wait times: lower than expected new patient wait times do not increase referrals above the norm. (pct)
Intake Effect of Work Pressure on Overtime	When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure." One response to increasing work pressure is for the team to work overtime. The more work pressure a team experiences for a specific service, the greater this effect, and the more the overtime the team will work in that specific service. This effect only applies to increasing work pressure: having fewer appointments on the calendar that the team can see in a timely way does not influence providers to work fewer hours. (pct)
Intake Engagement Duration	
Intake Evaluation Rate	All patients start services with the team by developing an individual treatment plan during an intake appointment. This new patient referral rate is determined by the baseline service capacity, average time in service, and the demand per patient per week. It can also be set by the user (with "User-defined Referrals to Team) or by the team's own data on new patient starts. These referrals can also be affected by perceptions of new patient wait times. New patient referrals are constrained from going below zero.
Intake Hours for Calculating Total Official Team Hours	Use the Baseline hours available for appointments for calculating the Total Official Team Clinical Hours, unless the users has set a new value for a service.
Intake Intake Evaluation Wait Time	The wait time for intake evaluations with this team. (wks)
Intake Maximum Completion Rate	The maximum completion rate is determined by the appointment backlog and minimum time between patient appointments.
Intake Maximum Start Rate Intake	The maximum new patient start rate is determined by the new patient waiting list and minimum time to schedule patient appointments.
Intake Minimum Time to Schedule	The fastest possible time to schedule a new patient appointment.
Intake New Pt Appts / week	Total number of new patient appointments per week.
Intake Official Hours Available for Service	The hours available for patient appointments in each service depends on the baseline hours offered and the effect of burnout on those hours. Official hours are prevented from going below zero.

Intake Return Visit Interval (median)	The median return-to-clinic visit interval for visits in each service with this team, calculated from the number of visits per patient over their entire engagement time. (wks)
Intake Sensitivity of Intake Evaluation Rate to Wait Times	This controls the magnitude of the effect increases in wait time have on the inflow of patients for intake evaluations, where these drop as wait time increases. A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between wait time and the demand for intake evaluations. A value of "1" indicates that if the wait time doubles, then the demand for intake evaulations will be cut in half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would result in less of an effect (reducing the demand for intake evaluations to 71% of its original value), and a value of "1.5" would result in a greater effect (reducing the demand for intake evaluations to less than 35% of its original value).
Intake Time per Appointment	The appointment length for a service;aka, the productivity.

Intake User-defined Intake Evaluation Rate	The number of patients referred to intake evaluations with the team each week. This replaces the base case value, which is estimated from team data on supply allocated to conducting intake evaluations. (pts/wk)
Intake User-defined True Missed Appointment %	The percent of appointments that must be re-scheduled, as either the clinician or the patient missed the appointment. This replaces the base case value, which is estimated from team data. (appts/wk)
Intake Work Pressure	When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure." It is measured by the ratio of the hours needed for each service (based on the appointments on the calendar and the return to clinic interval) against the actual hours available for each service. When the team works the same hours as their patients need (so each patient can be seen at the appropriate return to clinic interval), then the ratio is 1. If a team has more appointments than they can see given the RVI, then work pressure will rise above 1. (pct)
Long-Term Overtime	The ratio of the team's total excess hours worked to their total official hours, averaged over the past year. When the team is working zero overtime, this ratio will be zero. If the team persistently works as much overtime as they have official time, then this ratio will climb to 100%. (pct)

MM Actual Return Visit Interval	The actual average return-to-clinic visit interval that patients experience. This is either the same as the RVI used when appointments are scheduled, or potentially longer, if the team reacts to work pressure by extending existing patients' RVI. Longer than desired RVIs do not cause patients or providers to cancel appointments. In theory, the actual RVI could be pushed to more than one year, but we've capped it at 52 weeks. (wks)
MM Actual Service Capacity	The effective total hours of clinical time available, based on the percentage of the total team hours allocated to each service, and the missed appointment percentage for each service. This assumes that all missed appointments are eventually rescheduled.
MM Actual True Missed Appointment %	The percent of appointments missed and rescheduled is affected by both the baseline rate and the effect of fatigue due to accumulated long hours. It is constrained from going below zero. The baseline rate can be replaced by a user-generated value between zero and 100%.
MM Appointment Rate for Service Capacity	The appointment completion rate is the rate at which appointments would be completed in each service by the current team at the standard allocation of hours and hours lost to appointment re-scheduling for each service. Used to initialize the model, so the referral, start, and end rates for patients in each service is in equilibrium.

MM Effect of Work Pressure on Scheduled Return Visit Interval	When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure." One response to increasing work pressure is for the team to see their patients less often. The more work pressure a team experiences for a specific service, the greater this effect, and the longer the scheduled return to clinic interval (RVI) for that specific service.

MM Initial Patients	The initial number of patients seen by the team is determined by the initial appointment completion rate and the demand per patient. Note that the equation type is INITIAL, which ensures that the initial patient load remains constant even if the appointment completion rate varies.

This value replaces the base case value, which is estimated from the team's data. (wks)
MM RVI	The team's goal to see each patient in each service once in every x week (default RVIs are based on the team's data). The default RVI can be replaced by a user-generated value between 1 and 16 weeks. The "RVI" for Intake is always 1 week, which ensures that patients only have one intake appointment before completing Intake.
MM RVI used when Completing	Appointments are completed based on the RVI in use at the time they were booked. Any change in the RVI does not affect appointments already booked, only appointments being booked (i.e., appointments are not cancelled and rescheduled when RVI changes).

Specifically, based on a count of all unique patients in the cohort with >1 visit (thus, excluding"1-n-done" patients) in a service (as identified by CPT code set) over the total patient cohort. These percentages will sum to >100%, as many patients use multiple services concurrently.

Psych Rescheduling Rate	The rescheduling rate for each service depends on the total number of appointments to reschedule and the average time it takes to reschedule them. (appts/wk)
Psych Return Visit Interval (median)	The median return-to-clinic visit interval for visits in each service with this team, calculated from the number of visits per patient over their entire engagement time. (wks)
Psych Return Visit Interval (RVI)	The scheduled average return to clinic visit interval for each service, regardless of whether or not the team has enough supply for the patient demand or the effect on new patient starts. This value replaces the base case value, which is estimated from the team's data. (wks)
Psych RVI	The team's goal to see each patient in each service once in every x week (default RVIs are based on the team's data). The default RVI can be replaced by a user-generated value between 1 and 16 weeks. The "RVI" for Intake is always 1 week, which ensures that patients only have one intake appointment before completing Intake.
Psych RVI used when Completing	Appointments are completed based on the RVI in use at the time they were booked. Any change in the RVI does not affect appointments already booked, only appointments being booked (i.e., appointments are not cancelled and rescheduled when RVI changes).
Psych Scheduled Return Visit Interval	The return-to-clinic visit interval (RVI) used when scheduling appointmnents for existing patients in each service. It is either the same as the RVI from the team's data, or longer, depending on how the team chooses to react to increasing work pressure. (wks)
Psych Service Proportions	The service percentage used by the team.
Psych Service Proportions Balanced Across Team Variables	The percentage of patients who complete an intake who start another service, determined by the available capacity to treat those patients. If any of these percentages is >1, then there is enough supply for patients to enroll in a service multiple times simultaneously.
Psych Service Proportions from Team Data	The proportion of patients who start in each service with this team. The percentages sum to more than one, because patients may engage in multiple services concurrently. (pct)
Psych Starting a Service Rate	The number of patients who start each service each week. It is based on the number of appointments remaining each week, after all exisiting patients are seen in a timely manner. The team either satisfies all the demand from existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) or uses all the supply (based on the Appointment Supply), leaving no appointments available for new patients. (pts/wk)
Psych Starting a Service w AUD	The number of patients per week starting AUD treatment after developing an individual treatment plan in an intake appointment.
Psych Starting a Service w DEP	The number of patients per week starting Depression treatment after developing an individual treatment plan in an intake appointment.
Psych Starting a Service w Other Needs	The number of patients per week starting Other Needs treatment after developing an individual treatment plan in an intake appointment.
Psych Starting a Service w OUD	The number of patients per week starting OUD treatment after developing an individual treatment plan in an intake appointment.
Psych Starting a Service w PTSD	The number of patients per week starting PTSD treatment after developing an individual treatment plan in an intake appointment.
Psych Time per Appointment	The appointment length for a service;aka, the productivity.
Psych Treatment Decision Rate	The number of patients who are recommended to start in each service each week, after either completing an intake evaluation appointment or a review. Providers can decide to start patients on multiple services simultaneously. (pts/wk)
Psych True Missed Appointment %	The proportion of appointments for each service with this team that no-showed or were cancelled after the appointment was supposed to have happened. (pct)
Psych True Missed Appointment Rate	The number of appointments that must be re-scheduled, as either the clinician or the patient missed the appointment, calculated from the team's data. (appts/wk)
Psych User-defined Engagement Duration	The percentage of patients who are recommended to start each service after completing either an intake evaluation or review. These replace the base case values, which are estimated from team data on the appointment supply, Return-to-clinic Visit Interval (RVI), missed appointment percentage, and median engagement (i.e., the available capacity to treat patients in a timely manner) in each service. These percentages can sum to >1, as providers can decide to start a patient in multiple services. (pct)
Psych User-defined Service Proportions from Team Data	The percentage of patients who are recommended to start each service after completing either an intake evaluation or review. These replace the base case values, which are estimated directly from team data on new service start rates for each service in the team (i.e., haven't had this service in the team in the last six months). These percentages can sum to >1, as providers can decided to start a patient in multiple services. (pct)
Psych User-defined True Missed Appointment %	The percent of appointments that must be re-scheduled, as either the clinician or the patient missed the appointment. This replaces the base case value, which is estimated from team data. (appts/wk)
Psych Work Pressure	When the team has more appointments than they can see in a timely way, they feel "work pressure." It is measured by the ratio of the hours needed for each service (based on the appointments on the calendar and the return to clinic interval) against the actual hours available for each service. When the team works the same hours as their patients need (so each patient can be seen at the appropriate return to clinic interval), then the ratio is 1. If a team has more appointments than they can see given the RVI, then work pressure will rise above 1. (pct)
Review Rate	
SAVEPER	The frequency with which output is stored.
Sensitivity of Overtime to Work Pressure	This controls the magnitude of the effect work pressure has on overtime, where an increase in appointment backlog causes the team to work more "unofficial" hours to increase the completion rate to mitigate that increase. A value of "zero" implies that the team will not use overtime or overbook appointments for any amount of work pressure. A value of "1" implies that there is a direct relationship between work pressure and the amount of overtime used (e.g., doubling the work pressure will also double the hours worked per week). For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would only increase the hours worked to 41% over the original value, and a value of 1.5 would increase the hours worked to 182% over the original value.
Sensitivity of Patient's Engagement Time to Provider Fatigue	This controls the magnitude of the effect provider fatigue has on patients' duration in each service, where the total time in a service drops as fatigue increases. A value of "zero" implies that provider fatigue will have no effect on patient satisfaction. A value of "1" implies the assumption that doubling provider fatigue (e.g., short-term increases in work hours) will reduce the patients percieved quality of service, and thus patients' willingness to remain in that service by half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would reduce the average duration in that service to 71% of the original time in service, and a value of 1.5 would reduce the duration to only 35% of the original duration.
Sensitivity of Scheduled Return Visit Interval to Work Pressure	This controls the magnitude of the effect of work pressure has on the return to clinic interval (RVI), where an increase in appointment backlog causes the team to extend the scheduled RVI for current patients. A value of "zero" implies that the team will not delay existing patients' care (i.e., extend patients' RVI) for any amount of work pressure. A value of "1" implies that there is a direct relationship between work pressure and RVI (e.g., doubling the work pressure will also double the RVI). For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would only increase the RVI by 41% over its original value, and a value of 1.5 would increase the RVI by 182% over the original value.
Sensitivity of Staff Burnout Due to Long-Term Overtime	This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in overtime has on team burnout and quits. A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overtime and burnout and quits. A value of "1" implies the assumption that doubling the hours worked over the official hours will eventually cause enough quits to cut the official hours offered in half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would eventually reduce the official team hours to 71% of its original value, and a value of 1.5 would reduce the official hours to 35% of the original.
Sensitivity of Staff Missed Appointments Due to Short-Term Overtime	This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in overtime have on time for non-patient-facing care tasks and missed appointments. A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overtime and missed appointments. A value below 1 indicates that providers are not sensitive to small changes in overtime and non-patient-facing task time; a value greater than 1 indicates that providers are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week than their official supply, then an value of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% higher than before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20% increase in hours worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5% increase in the missed appointment percentage). A value of "2" would cause that same 20% increase to have a greater effect ( raising the missed appointment percentage by 44%).
Sensitivity of Treatment Decisions to Existing Patient Care Delays	This controls the magnitude of the effect existing patient care delays have on the team's treatment decisions, where decisions to start patients in a service drop as actual return to clinic visit interval increases (relative to target RVI). A value of "zero" implies that that no amount of care delay will influence the team's treatment decisions. A value of "1" implies that doubling the time between appointments for existing patients (e.g., delaying their care) will reduce the decisions to start in that service by half. For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would reduce the decisions to start in that service to 71% of the original rate, and a value of "1.5" would reduce the decisions to start to only 35% of the original rate.
Short-Term Overtime	The ratio of the team's total excess hours worked to their total official hours, averaged over the past 3 weeks. When the team is working zero overtime, this ratio will be zero. If the team is working as much overtime as they have official time, then this ratio will be 100%. (pct)
TIME STEP	The time step for the simulation.
Time to Change Scheduled RVI	Takes 2 weeks to recognize work pressure and change scheduled return visit interval.
Time to Change Staff Hours	Takes 4 weeks to recognize work pressure and change staff hours.
Time to Perceive Internal Delays	Time to notice and respond to differences between desired and actual Return Visit Interval and care delays within a team. Set to 8 weeks, i.e., it takes two monthly staff meeting updates to affect behavior.
Time to Reschedule	Average time to contact the patient and negotiate a make-up appointment.
Total Actual Hours Available for Service	The clinician time available for a service depends on the total clinical hours available, the relative increase in hours due to overtime, and the % allocated to a service.
Total Appt. Supply	The sum of all clinical hours allocated to patient appointments. It must be less than 40 hrs/week/clinician, due to administrative duties, sick leave, annual leave, training, etc.

Total Starting any Service w PTSD	The total number of patients starting across all services who have PTSD as a primary diagnosis.
Use Team Data on New Pt Referrals	"Balanced" mode continually adjusts the service proportions to both minimize new patient wait time and maximize the likelihood that an existing patient will receive care at the desired Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval, i.e., the team in the model will always decide to start just the right number of patients in each service, given the team's quality goals, supply, and patients' characteristics. In this mode, the service proportions automatically re-balance to accommodate any experiment. The base-case values for these parameters may differ from the estimates calculated from team data.
User-defined Review Rate	The number of patients whose care plan is reviewed and start a new service each week. This replaces the base case value, which is estimated from team data on service start rates and CPT-coded intake evaluation completed visits. (pts/wk)
